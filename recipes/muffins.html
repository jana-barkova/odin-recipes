     <h2>About muffins</h2>
          <p>
               A muffin is a small domed spongy breadâ€“ or cake-like baked food. There are two types of muffins: quick bread or English muffins and flatbread or American muffins. American muffins have round bases, rounded tops, and are usually sweet, but there are also savory kinds (like cornbread muffins).

               In Germany, rice pudding is often found premade in grocery stores, but making it at home is very easy, too. Long- and medium-grain white rice are the best choices, but Arborio or short-grain white rice is also good. Arborio will make a thicker, stickier rice pudding. Brown rice is an alternative, though it will need to be cooked longer and won't be as creamy as the white rice version.
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
          <li>2 medium eggs</li>
          <li>125ml vegetable oil</li>
          <li>250ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
          <li>250g golden caster sugar</li>
          <li>400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>100g chocolate chips or dried fruit such as sultanas or dried cherries (optional)</li>
          
     </ul>
     <h3>Method</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat 2 medium eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.</li>
          <li>Mix the rice, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan.</li>
          <li>Stir in the milk and add the piece of vanilla bean or the vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>Place the mixture over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.</li>
          <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice is soft and the mixture becomes thick. Stir often.</li>
          <li>Remove the vanilla bean and serve warm with cinnamon and sugar to taste. A dollop of fruit compote, fresh fruit, or your favorite combination of toppings makes this a really special sweet treat.</li>
          <li>Enjoy :-)</li>
