     <h2>About pancakes</h2>
          <p>
               A muffin is a small domed spongy breadâ€“ or cake-like baked food. There are two types of muffins: quick bread or English muffins and flatbread or American muffins. American muffins have round bases, rounded tops, and are usually sweet, but there are also savory kinds (like cornbread muffins).

               In Germany, rice pudding is often found premade in grocery stores, but making it at home is very easy, too. Long- and medium-grain white rice are the best choices, but Arborio or short-grain white rice is also good. Arborio will make a thicker, stickier rice pudding. Brown rice is an alternative, though it will need to be cooked longer and won't be as creamy as the white rice version.
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
          <li>1 cup white rice, long or medium grain</li>
          <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>4 cups milk</li>
          <li>1 (2-inch long piece) vanilla bean, split open; or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Method</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>Mix the rice, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan.</li>
          <li>Stir in the milk and add the piece of vanilla bean or the vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>Place the mixture over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.</li>
          <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice is soft and the mixture becomes thick. Stir often.</li>
          <li>Remove the vanilla bean and serve warm with cinnamon and sugar to taste. A dollop of fruit compote, fresh fruit, or your favorite combination of toppings makes this a really special sweet treat.</li>
          <li>Enjoy :-)</li>

     </ol>
