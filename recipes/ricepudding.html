     <h2>About pudding rice</h2>
     <p>
          Almost all cuisines around the world have their own version of rice pudding. A classic sweet dish made out of rice and a few other ingredients like sugar and cinnamon, it's always a comforting meal. This delicious German take on it makes for a creamy and perfectly sweet recipe that can be eaten as a breakfast, snack, and sometimes as lunch or dinner when served with additional fruit, apple sauce, or fruit compote. Our milchreis is the perfect alternative to your morning oatmeal or a great option for a warm dessert.

          In Germany, rice pudding is often found premade in grocery stores, but making it at home is very easy, too. Long- and medium-grain white rice are the best choices, but Arborio or short-grain white rice is also good. Arborio will make a thicker, stickier rice pudding. Brown rice is an alternative, though it will need to be cooked longer and won't be as creamy as the white rice version.
