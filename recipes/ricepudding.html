     <h2>About pudding rice</h2>
     <p>
          Almost all cuisines around the world have their own version of rice pudding. A classic sweet dish made out of rice and a few other ingredients like sugar and cinnamon, it's always a comforting meal. This delicious German take on it makes for a creamy and perfectly sweet recipe that can be eaten as a breakfast, snack, and sometimes as lunch or dinner when served with additional fruit, apple sauce, or fruit compote. Our milchreis is the perfect alternative to your morning oatmeal or a great option for a warm dessert.

          In Germany, rice pudding is often found premade in grocery stores, but making it at home is very easy, too. Long- and medium-grain white rice are the best choices, but Arborio or short-grain white rice is also good. Arborio will make a thicker, stickier rice pudding. Brown rice is an alternative, though it will need to be cooked longer and won't be as creamy as the white rice version.
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
          <li>1 cup white rice, long or medium grain</li>
          <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>4 cups milk</li>
          <li>1 (2-inch long piece) vanilla bean, split open; or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Method</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>Mix the rice, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan.</li>
          <li>Stir in the milk and add the piece of vanilla bean or the vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>Place the mixture over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.</li>
          <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice is soft and the mixture becomes thick. Stir often.</li>
          <li>Remove the vanilla bean and serve warm with cinnamon and sugar to taste. A dollop of fruit compote, fresh fruit, or your favorite combination of toppings makes this a really special sweet treat.</li>
          <li>Enjoy :-)</li>
